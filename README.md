# US STATE SDG INDEX AND DASHBOARDS REPORT 2018  
## Sustainable Development Report of the US 
US State-level data from 2018 Index and Dashboards

## Report Description
This report analyzes the baseline of the 50 US states on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs were unanimously adopted by the world’s governments in September 2015 as the globally agreed framework to achieve sustainable development, meaning the combination of social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and economic development. The SDGs thereby constitute a set of globally agreed goals for achieving sustainable development with quantified targets for the year 2030. This report, building on the [Global SDG Index and Dashboards](https://github.com/sdsna/2019GlobalIndex) published each year by the Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and on SDSN’s 2017 and 2018 [US Cities Index Reports](https://github.com/sdsna/2018USCitiesIndex), draws on 103 indicators at the US State level. While in some cases the indicators are identical across reports, in others the indicators vary due to data availability and varying policy relevance at different levels of governance. The results show significant geographical variation across the US, as well as the need for significant improvements nationwide to achieve No Poverty (Goal 1), Gender Equality (Goal 5), Reduced Inequalities (Goal 10), Climate Action (Goal 13) and Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions (Goal 16).
